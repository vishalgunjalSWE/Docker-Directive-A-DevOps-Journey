## 📑 Table of Contents

### [1. History and Motivation](01-history-and-motivation/README.md)  
📜 Explore the **evolution of virtualization technologies**—from bare-metal setups to virtual machines and containers. Understand the **trade-offs** between these approaches and how Docker emerged as a lightweight solution to optimize resource utilization and scalability.

### [2. Technology Overview](02-technology-overview/README.md)  
🔧 Delve into the **core Linux features** (cgroups, namespaces, and union filesystems) that enable containerization. Learn about Docker’s architecture and how its components interact to deliver isolated, reproducible environments for running applications.

### [3. Installation and Setup](03-installation-and-set-up/README.md)  
🛠 Step-by-step instructions on how to **install and configure Docker Desktop** for different platforms. Get your local environment ready to create and manage containers.

### [4. Using 3rd Party Containers](04-using-3rd-party-containers/README.md)  
📦 Before building your own container images, get familiar with **public container images**. Learn how to pull, run, and manage containers from Docker Hub, and explore key use cases like data persistence and environment configuration.

### [5. Example Web Application](05-example-web-application/README.md)  
🌐 Apply your knowledge with a hands-on example: a **3-tier web application** built with a React frontend, two APIs (Node.js and Go), and a database. This section provides a practical understanding of how microservices are containerized and orchestrated.

### [6. Building Container Images](06-building-container-images/README.md)  
🏗 Learn how to write efficient **Dockerfiles** and build container images for each component of the example web app. Start with a basic setup and optimize it for a **production-ready image** that balances performance, security, and maintainability.

### [7. Container Registries](07-container-registries/README.md)  
📥 Understand the role of **container registries** like Docker Hub and Amazon ECR in distributing and storing images. Learn how to **push and pull images** to/from a registry and manage your image versions effectively.

### [8. Running Containers](08-running-containers/README.md)  
🚀 With the web application containerized, this section covers how to **run and manage containers** using Docker commands and Docker Compose. Learn important runtime configuration options, such as environment variables, volumes, and networking.

### [9. Container Security](09-container-security/README.md)  
🔒 Security is crucial in production environments. This section highlights **best practices** for securing container images and runtime environments, covering topics like **image vulnerability scanning**, **least-privilege principles**, and **securing data** in containers.

### [10. Interacting with Docker Objects](10-interacting-with-docker-objects/README.md)  
⚙️ Master the commands to interact with **Docker objects** such as containers, images, volumes, and networks. Learn how to inspect, modify, and optimize these objects for smoother development and deployment workflows.

### [11. Development Workflows](11-development-workflow/README.md)  
💡 Streamline your development process by establishing **tooling and configuration** that integrates seamlessly with containers. Explore tips for using Docker in a local development environment, including hot-reloading, multi-stage builds, and CI/CD pipelines.

### [12. Deploying Containers](12-deploying-containers/README.md)  
🚢 Deploying containerized applications is the final step. Here, you'll learn to deploy using multiple strategies: **Railway.app**, a **Docker Swarm** for single-node orchestration, and a full-blown **Kubernetes cluster**. Each method illustrates different use cases, from simple setups to highly scalable solutions.
